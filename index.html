    <h1>Voltaic: Charge Devices On The Go With This Portable Solar Charger</h1>

    <img src="images/portable-amp-solar-charger.jpg">
    
    <p>I love snowboarding. I also love digital media. As our devices become more powerful, they require more power. One thing that your average mountain lacks is power points to charge your devices. So how can I get a full day of snowboarding and keep my camera and phone fully charged as well? You can charge your devices on the go with the Voltaic portable solar charger to get the most out of your devices and from your day on the mountain.</p>
    
    <p>The versatile Voltaic solar charger is really compact and travel friendly. It’s also waterproof, lightweight and designed for a bit of action. It has two <strong>2.0 watt solar panels</strong> (4 watts total peak output at 6 or 12 Volts ~ selectable depending on charging application) which means five hours in the sun charges a typical Smartphone or camera. One hour should provide about 1.5 hours of talk time.</p>
    
    <p>The Voltaic pack includes a lithium polymer universal battery, which can also be charged using the <strong>USB Power Cable or optional AC travel charger or DC car charger</strong>. This makes it equally as useful on the grid as off.</p>

    <p>The Voltaic packs 600D shell is actually made from recycled PET (soda bottles) and is also UV resistant. With four times the power and twice the battery storage of most solar chargers on the market, it is a sustainable power option for charging your devices that will help lower your carbon footprint.</p>    
         

    
    <p><strong>Not a snowboarder?</strong> Other cool uses for this versatile solar charger might include:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Keeping your digital camera charged</li>
    <li>Blogging on the beach with your tablet</li>
    <li>Charging your GPS while sailing</li>
    <li>Maintaining a power supply while hiking or camping</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Planning a picnic and want to blast your iPod in the park all afternoon?</strong> No need to worry about a power source anymore. As long as you have the Voltaic solar charger and the sun is shining you’ll have more power than your devices need wherever you are.</p>
    
    <p>As our digital media consumption habits evolve, we are using more power than ever before. The sun is such an excellent source of free energy, so it makes perfect sense to utilize it to power our devices.</p>
